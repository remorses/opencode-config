# Searching X via grok CLI

The `grok` CLI has 4 native X search tools. You invoke them by running grok in single-turn mode with a precise prompt that names the tool and its parameters.

```bash
grok -p '<prompt>' -m grok-build --always-approve
```

`-p` runs a single-turn prompt and exits. `-m grok-build` selects the model with native X tools (other models like `grok-composer-2.5-fast` cannot call them). `--always-approve` skips tool approval prompts (optional; native X tools auto-approve, but add it when combining with other tools).

Ignore stderr noise from strada traces. Only stdout matters.

## Tools

### x_keyword_search

The most powerful search tool. Supports the full set of X advanced search operators in the query string.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required) — search string with operators
- `limit` (optional) — max 10, default 3
- `mode` (optional) — `"Top"` (default) or `"Latest"`

**Prompt template:**

```
Use x_keyword_search to search "<QUERY>" with mode "<MODE>" and limit <N>.
For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted
verbatim, and engagement counts (likes, reposts, views).
```

**Search operators** you can put inside the query string:

sinner within_time:24h min_faves:20
filter:images from:janniksin
```

Always use `mode "Latest"` when searching for recent news or events. Use `mode "Top"` for popular/trending content on a topic.

### x_semantic_search

Relevance-based search. Good for conceptual queries like "what people think about X" or "news about Y". Returns posts ranked by semantic relevance (vector similarity) rather than recency.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required) — natural language search query
- `limit` (optional) — max 10, default 3
- `from_date` (optional) — `YYYY-MM-DD`, posts from this date onward
- `to_date` (optional) — `YYYY-MM-DD`, posts up to this date
- `usernames` (optional) — array of usernames, restrict to these authors only
- `exclude_usernames` (optional) — array of usernames to exclude
- `min_score_threshold` (optional) — relevance cutoff, default 0.18. Raise to 0.3-0.5 for stricter matches, lower for broader but noisier results.

**How scoring works:** embedding-based similarity between query and post content. Results are ranked by internal relevance score. `min_score_threshold` filters out posts below that score. Date bounds narrow the pool before semantic ranking.

**Prompt template:**

```
Use x_semantic_search with query "<QUERY>", from_date "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
to_date "<YYYY-MM-DD>", and limit <N>. For each result show: post ID,
author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, and any URLs in the post.
```

Use semantic search when:
- You want conceptual matches, not just keyword hits
- The topic is broad ("what are people saying about AI agents")
- You want to filter by date range without learning operator syntax

Use keyword search when:
- You need precise/latest results
- You want to combine multiple filters (user + date + engagement)
- You need exact phrase matching

### x_user_search

Find X users by name or handle.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required) — name or handle to search for
- `count` (optional) — number of results, default 3

**Return fields per user:** ID (snowflake), display name, handle, avatar URL, follower count, verified status ("Blue Verified" / "Verified Organization" / absent), bio (when present). Does not return following count, joined date, or post count.

**Prompt template:**

```
Use x_user_search to find "<NAME_OR_HANDLE>" with count <N>.
For each result show: display name, handle, bio, and follower count.
```

### x_thread_fetch

Read a full post with its conversation context (parent posts above it and replies below it).

**Parameters:**
- `post_id` (required) — the numeric post ID (get this from search results)

**What it returns:**
- The **root post** of the conversation (ancestor)
- The **requested post** (labeled explicitly when it differs from root)
- **Parent chain** between root and requested post
- **Replies** to the requested post (direct + some nested; limited window, not all replies)
- **Quoted posts** fully embedded with the same fields

**Fields per post:** ID, conversation ID, author (name, handle, avatar, bio), timestamp, engagement (likes, reposts, quotes, replies, bookmarks, views), media (type, URLs, video duration), full text, quoted post (nested).

**Prompt template:**

```
Use x_thread_fetch with post_id "<ID>". Show the full thread: for each post
in the conversation show the author handle, date, full text quoted verbatim,
and whether it is a parent, the target post, or a reply.
```

## Common workflows

### Latest news on a topic

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "<TOPIC> since:2026-06-20 min_faves:10" with mode "Latest" and limit 10. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, and engagement counts (likes, reposts, views).' -m grok-build
```

### What a specific user posted recently

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "from:<HANDLE> since:2026-06-01" with mode "Latest" and limit 5. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, and engagement counts.' -m grok-build
```

### Search + read the best thread

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "<QUERY>" with mode "Latest" and limit 5. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full text verbatim, engagement. Then use x_thread_fetch on the post with the most likes to show its full conversation context.' -m grok-build --always-approve
```

### Find a user then read their posts

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_user_search to find "<NAME>" with count 3. Show display name, handle, bio, follower count. Then use x_keyword_search to search "from:<BEST_HANDLE>" with mode "Latest" and limit 5, showing post ID, date, full text, and engagement for each.' -m grok-build --always-approve
```

## Exploring post relationships

### Find all quotes of a post

Use `quoted_tweet_id:` in `x_keyword_search`. Returns all posts that quote the target.

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "quoted_tweet_id:<POST_ID>" with mode "Latest" and limit 10. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, engagement.' -m grok-build
```

### Find all replies in a thread

Use `conversation_id:` to get all replies in a conversation. The conversation ID is the root post's ID.

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "conversation_id:<ROOT_POST_ID> filter:replies" with mode "Latest" and limit 10. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, engagement.' -m grok-build
```

Alternatively, use `x_thread_fetch` on the post ID to get the parent chain + replies in one call.

### Find posts with images/videos from a user

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "from:<HANDLE> filter:images since:2026-06-01" with mode "Latest" and limit 10. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, engagement, and direct image URLs from media attachments.' -m grok-build
```

### Find posts linking to a specific domain

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "url:github.com min_faves:50 since:2026-06-20" with mode "Latest" and limit 10. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, engagement.' -m grok-build
```

### Find posts near a location

```bash
grok -p 'Use x_keyword_search to search "tennis geocode:51.5074,-0.1278,25km since:2026-06-20" with mode "Latest" and limit 5. For each result show: post ID, author handle, date, full post text quoted verbatim, engagement.' -m grok-build
```

## Decision rule

- **Discover posts by keyword, operator, or filter** -> `x_keyword_search`
- **Conceptual / relevance search with date range** -> `x_semantic_search`
- **Find a user profile** -> `x_user_search`
- **Read full thread given a post ID** -> `x_thread_fetch`
- **Already have a tweet URL and just need text** -> use the `reading-x-posts` skill instead (oEmbed, no grok needed)

## Tips

- Always ask grok to **quote the full post text verbatim**. Without this instruction it tends to summarize.
- Always ask for **post IDs** in search results so you can follow up with `x_thread_fetch`.
- Always ask for **engagement counts** (likes, reposts, views) to gauge post quality.
- `x_keyword_search` limit max is 10. For broader searches, run multiple queries with different `since:/until:` windows.
- `x_semantic_search` can return spam or low-quality results. Add `min_score_threshold` (e.g. 0.3) to filter.
- The `from:` operator in keyword search does not need the `@` prefix. Use `from:elonmusk` not `from:@elonmusk`.
- These are the **only 4 native X tools**. There is no direct "get post by ID", "get user timeline", "get followers", "get trends", or "get lists" tool. Use keyword search operators to approximate these (e.g. `from:user` for timeline).
- `in_reply_to_tweet_id:` can be flaky with upstream errors. Prefer `conversation_id:` or `x_thread_fetch` for replies.
- `filter:nativeretweets` only covers recent ~7-10 days.
- Always ask for **media URLs** when searching for images/videos. Without this instruction grok may note "media attached" without giving the direct URL.
