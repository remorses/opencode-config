# Stripe disputes

Full workflow for responding to Stripe chargebacks: list disputes, collect evidence, generate PDFs, and submit. Focused on SaaS and digital product businesses.

## How disputes work

When a customer files a chargeback, you get **one chance** to submit evidence. The card issuer (customer's bank) makes the final decision. You typically have **7-21 days** to respond. Missing the deadline is an automatic loss.

Bank reviewers handle thousands of disputes daily and spend roughly **90 seconds per case**. Your evidence must be scannable, factual, and directly contradict the cardholder's claim.

## CLI workflow

All `stripe` commands must go through your secrets manager (doppler, sigillo, etc.) so the correct API key is injected. See the [stripe skill](../stripe/SKILL.md) for CLI auth setup.

### List open disputes needing response

```bash
# List disputes that need evidence (adapt doppler/sigillo to your project)
doppler run -c production -- stripe disputes list --limit 100 | \
  jq '[.data[] | select(.status == "needs_response" or .status == "warning_needs_response") | {
    id: .id,
    amount: (.amount / 100),
    currency: .currency,
    reason: .reason,
    status: .status,
    created: (.created | todate),
    due_by: (.evidence_details.due_by | todate),
    has_evidence: .evidence_details.has_evidence
  }]'
```

### One-liner for quick triage

```bash
doppler run -c production -- stripe disputes list --limit 100 | \
  jq '.data[] | select(.status == "needs_response") |
    "\(.id) | $\(.amount/100) \(.currency) | \(.reason) | due: \(.evidence_details.due_by | todate)"'
```

### Get details on a specific dispute

```bash
doppler run -c production -- stripe disputes retrieve dp_xxx | \
  jq '{
    id: .id, status: .status, amount: (.amount / 100), reason: .reason,
    due_by: (.evidence_details.due_by | todate),
    has_evidence: .evidence_details.has_evidence,
    submission_count: .evidence_details.submission_count,
    charge: .charge
  }'
```

### Find customer info from a dispute

```bash
# Get email and customer ID from the charge
doppler run -c production -- stripe charges retrieve ch_xxx | \
  jq '{customer: .customer, email: .billing_details.email, name: .billing_details.name}'
```

### Dispute statuses

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `needs_response` | Must submit evidence | **Respond** |
| `warning_needs_response` | Early warning, evidence recommended | **Respond** |
| `under_review` | Evidence submitted, bank reviewing | Wait |
| `won` | Resolved in your favor | None |
| `lost` | Bank sided with customer | None |
| `charge_refunded` | You refunded instead of disputing | None |

## What bank reviewers look for

Reviewers skim, not read. Structure evidence to be scannable in 90 seconds:

- **Investigation Summary at the top** with bold key facts (this is all most reviewers read)
- **Chronological timeline** of events
- **Screenshots with annotations** (bold text, arrows, circles; avoid color highlighting)
- **Conclusion** restating the 3-4 strongest points

Keep it **factual, professional, and concise**. Never complain about the customer. Never include irrelevant evidence (e.g. return policy for a "not received" dispute).

## File constraints

| Constraint | Limit |
|---|---|
| File types | PDF, JPEG, PNG only |
| Combined file size | **4.5MB** |
| Page count | **< 50** (general), **19** (Mastercard) |
| Font size | **12pt minimum** (Stripe requirement) |
| Document size | US Letter or A4, portrait |
| Color highlighting | **Avoid** (use bold, callouts, arrows) |

## Evidence fields (Stripe API)

When submitting via CLI or API, these are the fields to populate:

| Field | What to put | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `access_activity_log` | Timestamped user actions with IPs | Text |
| `customer_email_address` | Email on the Stripe customer | Text |
| `customer_purchase_ip` | IP address at checkout | Text |
| `product_description` | Concise SaaS product description | Text |
| `service_date` | Date service was delivered | Text |
| `service_documentation` | PDF proving service was rendered | **File upload** |
| `customer_communication` | Emails you sent to the customer | **File upload** |
| `receipt` | **Auto-filled by Stripe** (do NOT upload manually) | Auto |

### Upload and review before submitting

Stripe lets you upload evidence **without submitting** by passing `--submit false` (or omitting `--submit`). This saves the evidence as a draft visible in the Stripe Dashboard, where you can review everything before clicking "Submit" in the UI.

**Always use this two-step flow:**

1. Upload files and attach evidence with `--submit false`
2. Open the dispute in the Stripe Dashboard and review the full evidence packet
3. Only then submit, either from the Dashboard UI or by running a second `stripe disputes update` with `--submit true`

This is critical because submission is **irreversible**. Once submitted, you cannot edit or add evidence.

```bash
# 1. Upload evidence files
doppler run -c production -- stripe files create \
  -d "purpose=dispute_evidence" \
  -d "file=@./evidence.pdf"
# Returns file_xxx (save this ID)

doppler run -c production -- stripe files create \
  -d "purpose=dispute_evidence" \
  -d "file=@./email-evidence.png"
# Returns file_yyy (save this ID)

# 2. Attach evidence WITHOUT submitting (draft mode)
doppler run -c production -- stripe disputes update dp_xxx \
  --evidence.access-activity-log "$(cat ./access-activity-log.txt)" \
  --evidence.customer-email-address "user@example.com" \
  --evidence.customer-purchase-ip "203.0.113.42" \
  --evidence.product-description "React Export: SaaS plugin that converts Framer designs to production React components." \
  --evidence.service-date "2025-12-09" \
  --evidence.service-documentation file_xxx \
  --evidence.customer-communication file_yyy \
  --submit false

# 3. Review in Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes/dp_xxx
#    Check that all text fields, PDFs, and images look correct.

# 4. Submit ONLY after reviewing (irreversible)
doppler run -c production -- stripe disputes update dp_xxx --submit true
```

### Verifying generated evidence before uploading

**Always visually inspect every PDF and image before uploading to Stripe.** Open each file and verify:

- The PDF renders correctly (no missing fonts, no blank pages, no cut-off content)
- Images are clear and legible (no white rectangles, no corrupt files)
- Screenshots show the intended content with annotations visible
- Email images have correct from/to/subject/body text
- The activity log text reads chronologically and makes sense

Use `open ./output/evidence-dp_xxx.pdf` on macOS to preview PDFs. For images, use `open ./output/email-xxx.png` or the `read-media` tool if running inside an agent.

When running as an agent, always use the `read-media` tool on generated images and PDFs to verify their content before printing the upload commands. Do not blindly upload files you haven't inspected.

## What wins disputes for SaaS/digital products

Evidence ranked by strength (strongest first):

1. **Usage/access logs with timestamps and IPs** — proves the customer actively used the product after purchase. This is the single strongest piece of evidence for digital products.

2. **Proof of digital delivery** — screenshots of the delivered product (GitHub repos, dashboards, download confirmations, generated code).

3. **Custom emails sent** — welcome emails, delivery confirmations, onboarding messages. Render these as PNG images (see [Email evidence images](#email-evidence-images)).

4. **Prior undisputed transactions** (Visa CE 3.0) — 2+ prior charges from the same card that were not disputed. Proves the cardholder recognized and accepted charges from this merchant.

5. **No support contact** — prove the customer never reported an issue or contacted support before disputing. Shows the claim was filed without attempting resolution.

6. **Cancellation-to-dispute timeline** — disputes filed shortly after cancellation is a classic friendly fraud pattern ("subscription remorse").

7. **ToS/refund policy excerpt** — only the relevant section, never the entire document.

### What NOT to include

- **Stripe receipts** — Stripe auto-includes these in the `receipt` field. Uploading screenshots of Stripe receipts wastes page space on evidence the issuer already has.
- **Customer details table** — the issuer already has name, email, and billing address from the charge itself. Put these in the text fields (`--evidence.customer-email-address`) instead of the PDF.
- **Full terms of service** — only include the relevant excerpt with the specific clause highlighted.
- **Links to external websites** — reviewers will not click them. Screenshot the content instead.
- **Long explanations or complaints** — keep it factual and concise.

## Per-reason-code strategy

Tailor evidence to the specific dispute reason. Irrelevant evidence weakens your case.

### `product_unacceptable`

The customer claims the product was defective or unsatisfactory.

**Focus on:**
- Product **functioned as advertised** (feature verification, screenshots of working product)
- **Usage logs** showing the customer actively used the product
- **No support tickets** filed about functionality issues before the dispute
- Prior undisputed transactions (if customer paid for months without complaints)
- Cancellation timeline (disputes filed after cancellation = buyer's remorse)

### `product_not_received` (digital)

The customer claims they never received the product.

**Focus on:**
- **Access/download logs** with timestamps and IPs
- **Email notifications** confirming delivery
- **Screenshots** of the delivered digital product (repos, dashboards, accounts)
- Account activity showing the customer logged in and used the product

### `fraudulent`

The customer claims they did not authorize the transaction.

**Focus on:**
- **Authorization proof**: AVS match, CVC confirmation, 3D Secure authentication
- **IP address** matching billing address or historical user IPs
- **Prior undisputed transactions** (Visa CE 3.0; this is the strongest evidence for fraud disputes)
- Device fingerprint or customer account ID matching prior transactions

### `subscription_canceled`

The customer claims they canceled but were still charged.

**Focus on:**
- **No cancellation request** was received (check support logs, account settings)
- **Continued usage** after alleged cancellation date
- **Renewal reminder emails** sent before billing
- Subscription terms the customer agreed to at signup (relevant excerpt only)

## Visa Compelling Evidence 3.0 (CE 3.0)

CE 3.0 is the strongest tool for fighting friendly fraud on Visa transactions.

**Requirements:**
- Visa transaction with reason code 10.4 (card absent fraud)
- 2+ prior undisputed transactions from the same card, within 120-365 days
- Prior transactions must match on 2+ identifiers:
  - **Main**: customer purchase IP, shipping address
  - **Secondary**: device fingerprint, device ID, email, account ID
  - Valid combos: 2 main, or 1 main + 1 secondary

**Stripe auto-evaluates** eligibility and pre-populates evidence when possible. Check the Dashboard for CE 3.0 eligibility flags.

**In the PDF evidence**, highlight prior undisputed transactions prominently with a table showing charge date, amount, and whether it was disputed (YES/NO column).

## Generating evidence PDFs

Use `@react-pdf/renderer` to generate professional evidence PDFs. Load the [react-pdf skill](../react-pdf/SKILL.md) for full setup and typography guidance.

### Recommended structure

1. **Title**: "Dispute Evidence" (no subtitle clutter)
2. **Investigation Summary** (callout box with left-border accent): 3-5 bold key facts with arrow prefixes. This is the most important part; reviewers may read only this.
3. **Product Description**: concise description of the SaaS product
4. **Proof of Service Delivery**: activity timeline, exported components list, GitHub repo details
5. **Screenshots**: GitHub repos, delivered product, email images
6. **No Support Contact**: statement that customer never reported issues
7. **Prior Undisputed Transactions**: table with date, amount, disputed status
8. **Conclusion**: 3-4 bold bullet points restating strongest evidence

### Compact preset for evidence PDFs

Evidence PDFs should be dense. Use the compact preset from the react-pdf skill:

```tsx
const s = StyleSheet.create({
  page: {
    paddingTop: 36, paddingBottom: 36, paddingHorizontal: 48,
    fontFamily: 'Lora', fontSize: 9, lineHeight: 1.4, color: '#1a1a1a',
  },
  title: { fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: 16 },
  h2: { fontSize: 11, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 10, marginBottom: 4 },
  h3: { fontSize: 10, fontWeight: 700, marginTop: 8, marginBottom: 3 },
  paragraph: { marginBottom: 4 },
})
```

### Investigation Summary callout

```tsx
<View style={{ borderLeftWidth: 2.5, borderLeftColor: '#1a1a1a', paddingLeft: 10, paddingVertical: 4 }}>
  <Text style={{ fontSize: 11, fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: 3 }}>Investigation Summary</Text>
  <KeyFact>Customer actively used the service on day 1 (exported 2 projects, 14 components)</KeyFact>
  <KeyFact>4 prior monthly charges were undisputed</KeyFact>
  <KeyFact>Disputes filed 8 days after cancellation</KeyFact>
  <KeyFact>No support contact before disputing</KeyFact>
</View>
```

```tsx
const KeyFact = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', marginBottom: 2, marginLeft: 2 }}>
    <Text style={{ width: 14, fontWeight: 700 }}>{'\u25B6'}</Text>
    <Text style={{ flex: 1, fontWeight: 700 }}>{children}</Text>
  </View>
)
```

### Gotchas

- **Lora font digit rendering**: numbered headings (1., 2., etc.) get their digits eaten by the Lora font subset in react-pdf. Use unnumbered headings instead.
- **Image max height**: constrain screenshot images with `maxHeight: 500` so they don't overflow pages. Use `wrap={false}` on image containers to prevent splitting across pages (but remove it if the image is taller than a page).
- **Stripe 12pt font requirement**: the compact preset uses 9pt for body text. Stripe's docs say 12pt minimum. In practice, 9-10pt works fine as long as text is legible. If you want to be strictly compliant, use 12pt but accept fewer pages of content.

## Email evidence images

Generate PNG images that look like the emails you sent to customers. These are uploaded as `customer_communication` evidence.

### Approach

1. Build an email layout with `@react-pdf/renderer` (subject, from, to, date, body)
2. Render to PDF buffer with `renderToBuffer`
3. Convert first page to PNG with `pdf-to-img`
4. Trim whitespace with ImageMagick

```tsx
import { renderToBuffer } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

// Render the email document to PDF
const pdfBuffer = await renderToBuffer(<EmailDocument email={emailData} />)

// Convert to PNG
const { pdf: pdfToImg } = await import('pdf-to-img')
const doc = await pdfToImg(Buffer.from(pdfBuffer), { scale: 2 })
let pageBuffer: Buffer | null = null
for await (const page of doc) {
  pageBuffer = Buffer.from(page)
  break // only need first page
}

// Trim whitespace with ImageMagick
import { execSync } from 'node:child_process'
const tmpPath = outputPath + '.tmp.png'
fs.writeFileSync(tmpPath, pageBuffer)
try {
  execSync(`convert "${tmpPath}" -trim +repage -bordercolor white -border 40x30 "${outputPath}"`, { stdio: 'pipe' })
  fs.unlinkSync(tmpPath)
} catch {
  // ImageMagick not available, use untrimmed image
  fs.renameSync(tmpPath, outputPath)
}
```

### Email layout component

Use a narrow page width (520pt) so the image is email-shaped, not full letter width. Set page height to 1000 (react-pdf doesn't support auto-height); the ImageMagick trim step removes the whitespace.

```tsx
function EmailDocument({ email }: { email: EmailData }) {
  return (
    <Document>
      <Page size={{ width: 520, height: 1000 }} style={pageStyle}>
        <HeaderField label="From:" value={email.from} />
        <HeaderField label="To:" value={email.to} />
        <HeaderField label="Date:" value={email.dateSent} />
        <Text style={subjectStyle}>{email.subject}</Text>
        <View style={hrStyle} />
        {email.lines.map((line, i) => (
          <Text key={i} style={paragraphStyle}>{line}</Text>
        ))}
      </Page>
    </Document>
  )
}
```

### Dependencies

```bash
pnpm add @react-pdf/renderer react pdf-to-img
```

ImageMagick (`convert` command) is optional but recommended for trimming. Install with `brew install imagemagick` on macOS.

## Capturing screenshots with Playwriter

Use Playwriter to capture screenshots of GitHub repos, dashboards, or any authenticated web page. Load the [playwriter skill](../../kimakivoice/cli/skills/playwriter/SKILL.md) for full setup.

```ts
// Navigate and screenshot
playwriter run 'await page.goto("https://github.com/org/repo"); await page.screenshot({ path: "repo.png", fullPage: true })'
```

Screenshots are embedded in the evidence PDF as `<Image>` components.

## Collecting evidence from your database

The evidence collection script should query your database for:

- **Subscription details**: orgId, plugin name, status, creation date, cancellation date
- **Login sessions**: timestamps proving the customer accessed the product
- **Exported projects**: component counts, page counts, creation dates
- **GitHub repos**: repo names, creation dates, file counts, collaborator invites
- **Email history**: Resend message IDs, email content, send dates

Use `getPrismaForScripts()` (or your project's equivalent) for database access in scripts. Always run through doppler/sigillo for production queries.

## Activity logging (prevention)

To build strong evidence proactively, log user activity to a database table:

| Event | Data to capture |
|---|---|
| `CHECKOUT_COMPLETED` | IP from request headers, email, orgId |
| `PROJECT_EXPORTED` | Project name, component count, timestamp |
| `GITHUB_REPO_CREATED` | Repo name, file count |
| `COMPONENT_DOWNLOADED` | IP, timestamp, component IDs |
| `EMAIL_SENT` | Resend message ID, recipient, subject |
| `LOGIN` | IP, timestamp, session ID |

Each row should include: `orgId`, `userId`, `email`, `ip`, `event`, `metadata` (JSON), `createdAt`.

This table becomes the source for `access_activity_log` in dispute evidence. Without it, you have to reconstruct the timeline from scattered tables at dispute time.

## Automated dispute webhook (future)

For high-volume dispute handling, add a `charge.dispute.created` webhook handler that:

1. Looks up the org from the Stripe customer
2. Queries the activity log for that org
3. Formats the timeline as `access_activity_log` text
4. Generates the evidence PDF
5. Uploads files and submits evidence automatically

This is not required but significantly reduces response time and ensures no dispute is missed.
